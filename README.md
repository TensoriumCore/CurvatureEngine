# CurvatureEngine

## Overview
This project is a high-performance computational framework for solving geodesic equations and curvature tensors in General Relativity. It includes tools for computing Christoffel symbols, Ricci tensors, Riemann curvature tensors, and the evolution of spacetime using the ADM/BSSN formalism. The code supports multiple metrics, including Schwarzschild and Minkowski, and provides efficient numerical solvers.

## Features
- **Geodesic Integrator:** Computes null and timelike geodesics in curved spacetimes.
- **Curvature Tensor Computation in analytical formalism:** Computes Christoffel symbols, Riemann, Ricci, and Einstein tensors.
- **ADM Formalism Solver:** Implements the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) evolution equations for numerical relativity using a 3+1 decomposition.
- **Constraint Equations:** Enforces Hamiltonian and momentum constraints to ensure numerical stability.
- **Support for Multiple Metrics:** Includes Schwarzschild, Minkowski, and Kerr metrics, with extensibility to other spacetimes.
- **Parallelized Computation:** Optimized for multi-threading and SIMD vectorization to accelerate computations (Parallel computing is not ready atm so monothread atm...).
- **High-Precision Numerical Methods:** Uses high-order finite difference schemes for derivatives and tensor calculations.

## Compilation
This project is optimized for **Clang++** with advanced compiler flags for performance:
```sh
make
```


## Usage
Run the simulation with:
```sh
./CurvatureEngine <options>
```
Data will be stored in CSV and VTK (for extrinsic curvature tensor components and Geodesics)format for further analysis.

## Future Work
- Extend support to Kerr-Newman/dS/adS and other exotic spacetimes.
- Unit tests and debug mode.
- Class template to integrate your own problems
- Optimize for parallel computation.
- Optimize for parallel computation and SIMDs.
- Implement relativistic fluid dynamics.
- Implement GPU acceleration for faster computations.
- Improve numerical stability of high-curvature geodesics and ADM compute (AMR grid and CFL conditions).
- Implement spectral methods.
- Implement BSSN formalism (modern).
